# Stuff Documentation

This document explores the vision and the main philosophy behind [Stuff](https://github.com/yousifsabah0/stuff) and other technical documentations related to the project.

## Overview

I've spent so much time looking for an application where I can manage my tasks, goals, and habits with simple steps, without all the bloat, poor UIs, and privacy concerns. I want an application that lets me manage my life the way I want, and one I can access wherever I work (phone, laptop, website, and most importantly... the terminal). There are many apps that offer what I need, but I just don't like them. I want something that aligns with my vision, something built for myself.

That's why I'm starting this project, mainly for myself, but also to gain more experience.
